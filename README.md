Deploy a infrastructure AWS with ASG, LB,etc using terraform.

# IAC (Infrastrucute as Code)

With the advent of cloud computing, a new definition of infrastructure emerged: The possibility of provisioning infrastructure on demand and in an automated way through scripts (whether declarative or procedural). The IAC (infrastructure as code) gives us the possibility of building a cloud infrastructure (starting from the concept of immutability). Unlike on-premises company servers, where large teams are needed to maintain the data center, cloud computing gains traction and use with IAC.

Through yaml files, we were able to define the desirable state of our infrastructure.

The IAC is divided into 5 main pillars of possibility of action:

(i) AD-HOC scripts
It is possible to use commands for simple tasks which can be entered in a script that does small provisioning tasks. It's not the ideal use, but it's a possibility for simple tasks and tests from the command line.

(ii) Configuration Management tools

(iii) server templating tools

(iv) orchestration tools

(v) provisioning tools

- What is Terraform?
